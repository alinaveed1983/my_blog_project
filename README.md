Basic Production Setup (2 EC2 Instances)

    Components:
    EC2 Instance 1: Hosts the Django application.
    EC2 Instance 2: Hosts the MySQL database.

    Pros:
    Separates the application and database for better performance and security.
    Easier to scale the application server independently of the database.

    Cons:
    Slightly more complex to set up.
    Higher cost (two EC2 instances).
    Recommended EC2 Instance Types:
    Application Server: t2.micro or t3.micro (for small projects).
    Database Server: t2.micro or t3.micro.



Deployment Steps:
    
    EC2 Instance 1:
     1. Install Django, Gunicorn, and Nginx.
     2. Set up the Django application.

    EC2 Instance 2:
     1. Install MySQL and configure the database.
     2. Allow remote access from the application server (update MySQL settings and security group).
     3. Update Djangoâ€™s settings.py to connect to the MySQL database on EC2 Instance 2.
