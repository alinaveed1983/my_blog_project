Front-end development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
Back-end development (Python with Django).
Database management (MySQL).
Full stack integration.
Project Features
Home Page: Displays a list of all blog posts.

Basic Production Setup (2 EC2 Instances)

    Components:
    EC2 Instance 1: Hosts the Django application.
    EC2 Instance 2: Hosts the MySQL database.

    Pros:
    Separates the application and database for better performance and security.
    Easier to scale the application server independently of the database.

    Cons:
    Slightly more complex to set up.
    Higher cost (two EC2 instances).
    Recommended EC2 Instance Types:
    Application Server: t2.micro or t3.micro (for small projects).
    Database Server: t2.micro or t3.micro.



Deployment Steps:
    
    EC2 Instance 1:
     1. Install Django, Gunicorn, and Nginx.
     2. Set up the Django application.

    EC2 Instance 2:
     1. Install MySQL and configure the database.
     2. Allow remote access from the application server (update MySQL settings and security group).
     3. Update Django’s settings.py to connect to the MySQL database on EC2 Instance 2.
